                        <p>Lego Universe, or LU, is where it all began when our leaders, under the usernames Boyde712(Boyde) and Chromium(Chrome), 
							created our little group named Team Faction Alpha often referred to as Faction Alpha or TFA.</p>
                        <p>LU was a massively multiplayer online game that was only available from October 2010 to February 2012. It also had an 
							earlier beta starting at March 10, 2010 and ending on September 26 the same year. During this beta is when TFA was 
							created and the majority of our members were recruited. </p>

                        <p>Due to the rather short lifespan of LU the young Team Faction Alpha was forced to switch the platform that we were on. It was 
						decided that we would move to the game known as Minecraft. While the decision was made quickly it was not unanimous and a few of
						our members did not make the trip with us.</p>
                        <p>Minecraft nowadays is almost a household name known by all. Being released on the 18th of November 2011 it came out shortly 
						before the closing of LU. This made it a prime location for the migration of TFA. It was created and designed by Markus "Notch" 
						Persson. Being a sandbox game allowing players to be creative and build anything you could imagine made it perfect for a group 
						coming out of a game made of Lego.</p>

                        <p>After a couple years of playing only exclusively Minecraft we decided it was time for a new game and a new genre. we still
						played a lot of Minecraft on the side so it didn't affect our member count. However seeing as this game was not the team building
						coop like Minecraft it did test a few friendships.</p>
                        <p>By the title I sure your guessed the name of the game is of course Smite. Smite is a MOBA which stands for Multiplayer Online 
						Battle Arena. in this game you play as different "gods" from a wide range of pantheons from out history. The goal is to kill NPCs 
						called minions to level up your charator in order to gain the adge and defeat the other "gods"</p>

                        <p>We played Smite and Minecraft for another year before we again started to get bored with our current and somewhat limited 
						selection of games and genres. Lucky for us we had gotten older and many of us had gotten jobs allowing us a bit of disposable
						income to spend on new titles.</p>
                        <p>We soon found ourselves playing many games in almost every genre. From first person shooters all the way puzzle coop we played everything
						, although most of prefered to stay away from horror. We went back and played older classics such as Portal 2 and Left for Dead. We 
						played new titles on their release such as Player Unknown's BattleGrounds, Overwatch, Destiny 2 and everything inbetween.</p>
